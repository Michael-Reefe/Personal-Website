              <h2>About Me</h2>

              <p>Hi, I'm Michael! I'm a PhD candidate and NSF GRFP fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology working with 
              <a href="https://space.mit.edu/~mcdonald/" target="_blank">Professor Michael McDonald</a>. I study the gas and dust in and around galaxy clusters, 
              the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe. The gas and dust in these clusters, called the intracluster medium, 
              is rich with interesting physics and many unsolved mysteries, such as the cooling flow problem, that are ripe for analysis!
              My research is observationally oriented and data-driven, and I heavily utilize integral field unit spectroscopy in many different 
              bands of the electromagnetic spectrum to get a detailed picture of the physical processes that govern the
              dynamics and evolution of galaxy clusters.</p>

              <p>I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Physics, with a concentration in Astrophysics, from George Mason University in 2022, summa cum laude.
              I did research on a few different topics during my undergraduate studies. I worked on the validation of exoplanet candidates with the transit and radial
              velocity techniques, and the discovery of elusive active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies that exhibit high ionization potential "coronal"
              emission lines. Some common threads between these topics and my current research is the usage of medium resolution spectroscopy, integral field 
              spectroscopy, and coronal emission lines.</p>

              <p>Luckily for my advisors, I enjoy coding a lot, so much so that I even do it in my free time sometimes. 
              <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/michael-reefe/verbose-umbrella/ops/verbose_umbrella.py" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of a fun Python code I made for fun that explores 
              Hydrogen atom orbitals, Fourier series, Legendre Polynomials, and other things. Some other hobbies of mine include hiking, video games, and 
              dungeons & dragons.</p>

              <h3>Background: Galaxy Clusters and the Cooling Flow Problem</h3>

              <p>Galaxy clusters are collections of 100s-1000s of galaxies and are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe.
              Each galaxy cluster hosts a massive galaxy at its gravitational center, simply referred as the central or brightest cluster galaxy. These
              are some of the most massive galaxies in the known Universe, as they are the result of many generations of smaller galaxies merging and
              being eaten up by the central galaxy. But the stars and galaxies in the cluster only contain a small fraction of the cluster's luminous mass: 
              less than 10%. The other 90% is attributed to the gas and dust <i>between</i> the galaxies in the cluster, called the <b>intracluster medium</b>, 
              or ICM. The ICM is incredibly hot (10 million Kelvin) and diffuse (less than 1 particle per cubic centimeter), both of which make it hard for 
              it to cool down efficiently. However, the ICM tends to get cooler and more dense towards the center of the cluster, and in some clusters 
              where this effect is pronounced, we expect to see the gas cooling down, condensing, and falling inwards towards the cluster's central galaxy, 
              fueling star formation. Nevertheless, what we <i>actually</i> observe is that the gas does begin to cool out of the hot X-ray emitting
              phase, but it never makes it to the cold molecular phase to fuel star formation. Evidently, at some point, the gas either vanishes completely, 
              or is being reheated by some mechanism. This is known as the <b>cooling flow problem</b>.</p>

              <p>There are a number of theories that have been proposed to try to explain these counterintuitive results.  Many researchers think that an
              Active Galactic Nucleus, or AGN, is to blame for reheating and disturbing the ICM, preventing it from forming stars.  An AGN is composed of a
              supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy surrounded by a disk of hot gas and dust that is swirling around and feeding into 
              the black hole.  These are some of the most extreme objects in the Universe, and they can produce strong outbursts, winds, and radio jets (collectively
              referred to as "feedback") that all may contribute to stirring and heating up the surrounding gas in their host galaxy. This makes them a promising 
              candidate for resolving the cooling flow problem, but many questions still remain unanswered.  For example, we still don't know how quickly feedback 
              from an AGN is able to start balancing with the cooling gas, how this feedback can efficiently prevent cooling throughout the entire central volume 
              of a cluster, and how this balance evolves over time and over cosmic history. There are also alternate theories that propose that there is actually
              a large amount of gas that is able to cool (at least partially), but we are just unable to see it because the X-ray emission from this cooling gas 
              gets heavily absorbed by cold clouds of gas and dust before it reaches us.</p>

              <h3>My Research: The Cooling Rainbow</h3>

              <p>My current research focuses on multiwavelength studies of the intracluster medium to try to better understand the properties of the ICM, the cooling 
              flow problem, AGN feedback, and galaxy cluster evolution.  A big part of my work uses integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy, which is a revolutionary
              technique that enables us to obtain spatial and spectroscopic information simultaneously.  IFU instruments produce 3-dimensional "cubes" of data: You
              can think of this like a series of 2D images, each measuring slightly different wavelengths of light, all stacked on top of each other.  Or, you can
              think of it as single image, but each "pixel" in your image is actually an entire spectrum!  This dramatically increases the amount of information we
              can obtain about a galaxy or cluster of galaxies by allowing us to resolve many spectral features (i.e. continuum luminosities and slopes, gas emission lines,
              dust absorption and emission features, etc.) and map them out spatially all at the same time.</p>

              <p>I have been targeting so-called "coronal" emission lines, which are spectral features which require very high energies (ionization potentials above 90 eV) 
              to produce. These lines are most sensitive to cooling gas at temperatures of 100,000s of Kelvin, so they are particularly helpful in mapping out the ICM at 
              intermediate temperatures between the hot X-ray phase at 10 million Kelvin and the cold molecular phase at 10 Kelvin, revealing what happens to the gas as it
              is actually in the process of cooling down.  This is essentially the "smoking gun" of cooling gas in galaxy clusters!</p>

              <p>I have used world-class instrumentation with NASA's JWST mission in the infrared, HST in the UV/optical, and FUSE in the UV, to measure these coronal lines
              and map out cooling gas in galaxy clusters.  To learn more, check out my publications <a href="#publications" onclick="showSection('publications')">here</a>.</p>

          <h3><u><a href="MIT_Astro_168_MAR_meme_edition.pdf" target="_blank">The MIT Astro 168 Study Guide</a></u></h3>
          <p>
            The MIT physics department has an oral qualifying exam requirement that all PhD students must pass on their journey
            to becoming doctors. Each division of the physics department handles this exam differently. The astrophysics division 
            provides a list of 168 astrophysics-oriented questions that a student may potentially be asked during this exam, which 
            are meant to serve as a guidance for students' studying. During my studying for this exam, I typed up answers to each
            of these questions, and I've decided to provide these notes publicly here. My hope is that these notes will be useful not
            only to future generations of MIT PhD students, but also to anyone with an interest in astrophysics that wants to learn more
            about the topics that are studied in graduate school! I also hid some memes in there to break up the monotony of studying 
            every once in a while.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that these notes were created for the 2023-2024 academic year, and the list of questions may change in the future (as it has
            in the past).
