										<h3>Galaxy Clusters and the Cooling Flow Problem</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										Galaxy clusters are collections of 100s-1000s of galaxies and are the largest gravitationally bound structures in the universe.
										But the stars and galaxies in the cluster only contain a small fraction of the cluster's luminous mass---less than 10%. The other 90%
										is attributed to the gas and dust between the galaxies in the cluster, called the <b>intracluster medium</b> (ICM). In general, the ICM
										is incredibly hot (10 million Kelvin) and rarefied (less than 1 particle per cubic centimeter), which means it should not be able to cool
										off efficiently. However, the ICM tends to get cooler and more dense towards the center of the cluster, and in some clusters where this effect 
										is pronounced, we should expect to see the gas cooling down, condensing, and fueling star formation in the central brightest cluster galaxy
										within observable timescales. Nevertheless, what we <i>actually</i> observe is that the gas does begin to cool out of the hot X-ray emitting
										phase, but it never makes it to the cold molecular phase to fuel star formation. Evidently, at some point, the gas either vanishes completely,
										or is being reheated by some mechanism. This is known as the <b>cooling flow problem</b>.

												<h3>Coronal Emission Lines and Integral Field Unit Spectroscopy</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												My current research focuses on studying the ICM with integral field spectroscopy in galaxy clusters, with the aim of better understanding the 
												cooling flow problem, and how feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) plays a role in reheating the gas. Integral field spectroscopy is 
												revolutionary in that it enables us to obtain spatial and spectroscopic information simultaneously. We get an entire 3D "cube" of data, where each
												pixel in a flat 2D image contains an entire spectrum. I have been targeting coronal emission lines, which probe gas at intermediate temperatures 
												(100,000s of Kelvin), to reveal how the gas cools from the hot X-ray phase to the cold star-forming phase, using world-class instrumentation with 
												NASA's JWST mission in the infrared, as well as other instruments in the UV and optical.

												<h3>Active Galactic Nuclei</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												In addition to the ICM, coronal emission lines are also expected to be produced in the regions surrounding the hot accretion disks of AGNs.
												can sometimes produce high ionization-potential coronal emission lines (CLs) through collisional excitations, and subsequent radiative de-excitations, which can then be observed assuming the coronal line region is rarefied enough below the critical density of the CL in question.</p>
											<p>I conducted a wide-scale survey of almost 1 million optical SDSS spectra in search of these CLs.  Aside from the obvious conclusion that CL emission is rare, showing up in less than 0.02% of galaxies, we found that CL emission preferrentially shows up in lower mass galaxies compared to those identified with BPT ratios and WISE colors, potentially revealing a whole new population of dwarf galaxy AGNs.</p>

												<h3>Exoplanet Validations</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Each exoplanet candidate from NASA's <i>TESS</i> mission (and previously <i>Kepler</i>) requires a rigorous follow-up validation process with additional transit observations to eliminate nearby eclipsing binary scenarios, and radial velocities (RVs) to get a planet mass estimate.  When a planet orbits a star, its gravitational force induces a small "wobble" in the star around the barycenter of the system.  The radial velocity method takes advantage of the Doppler shift induced by this wobble to get a measurement of the planet's mass.</p>
											<p>We performed RV observations and analysis of the TOI 620 system, confirming a single planet, and the AU Mic system, with 2 planets.  AU Mic in particular is interesting because it is a very young star (~20 Myr), so any planets around it could provide valuable insights about how planets form and evolve in a debris disk.  But young stars are also very active spectroscopically, which makes their RVs very noisy and difficult to analyze. I worked with a graduate student, who developed a chromatic Gaussian Process (GP) kernel to help separate stellar activity from Keplerian planet signals, to analyze the AU Mic system and validate the 2 planets in it.</p>

												<h3>Telescope Automation</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The large volume of exoplanet candidates coming in from <i>TESS</i>, each with a need to be validated, drives a need for automated follow-up systems.  I led an effort to fully automate exoplanet <i>TESS</i> transit follow-up observations with the George Mason University 0.8-meter campus telescope.  The automation code was written in Python and developed in a fully asynchronous, multithreaded framework, which allowed us to maximize the efficiency of observations by reducing overhead and down-time between hardware operations like slewing the telescope and opening the dome shutter.</p>
											<p>The code is autonomous enough to run for multiple days or even weeks at a time, and is even able to focus and guide on the target and automatically collect calibration images (darks and flats).  But most importantly for a telescope in the humid climate of the East Coast, an automated weather monitor constantly checks the current conditions for high humidity, winds, precipitation, and cloud coverage, and causes the observatory to close up and pause operations during inclement weather.  This allows us to be confident in the safety of the automation code and save some nights of sleep.  As of 3/30/2022, the code has been used on 170 observing nights and counting!
