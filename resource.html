								<h3><u><a href="MIT_Astro_168_MAR_meme_edition.pdf">The MIT Astro 168 Study Guide</a></u></h3>
								<p>
									The MIT physics department has an oral qualifying exam requirement that all PhD students must pass on their journey
									to becoming doctors. Each division of the physics department handles this exam differently. The astrophysics division 
									provides a list of 168 astrophysics-oriented questions that a student may potentially be asked during this exam, which 
									are meant to serve as a guidance for students' studying. During my studying for this exam, I typed up answers to each
									of these questions, and I've decided to provide these notes publicly here. My hope is that these notes will be useful not
									only to future generations of MIT PhD students, but also to anyone with an interest in astrophysics that wants to learn more
									about the topics that are studied in graduate school! I also hid some memes in there to break up the monotony of studying 
									every once in a while.
								</p>
								<p>
									Note that these notes were created for the 2023-2024 academic year, and the list of questions may change in the future (as it has
									in the past).
								</p>

								<h3><u><a href="https://astrogazers.mit.edu/">MIT Astrogazers</a></u></h3>
								<p>
									The Astrogazers are an outreach group based out of the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research (MKI). We are passioante
									about sharing the wonders of the universe with the public in the greater Cambridge/Boston area and host many observing events whenever the 
									weather is favorable. Check out our website for more information about the team members and our event schedule.
								</p>

								<h3><u><a href="https://physics-gsc.scripts.mit.edu/home/">PGSC</a></u></h3>
								<p>
									The MIT Physics Graduate Student Council (PGSC) works with the department to improve the physics curriculum and 
									degree requirements at MIT, advises MIT graduate admissions, and organizes community events such as open houses for prospective 
									students, pizza and cookie socials, and end-of-year events. Learn more on the PGSC website!
								</p>

								<h3><u><a href="https://physrefs.mit.edu/">PhysREFS</a></u></h3>
								<p>
									The MIT Physics Resources for Easing Friction and Stress (PhysREFS) program organizes a mentorship program from senior graduate students 
									to provide students with the proper guidance and resources they need to get through their academic pursuits. They also provide study resources 
									to aid students in studying for the written qualifying exams. Check out the PhysREFS website for more details.
								</p>

								<h3><u><a href="https://gmuspectrum.squarespace.com">Spectrum</a></u></h3>
								<p>
									Spectrum is a student-led organization founded at George Mason University that is dedicated to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) 
									initiatives. Spectrum runs a student peer mentorship program, works with the GMU physics department to improve department policy, hiring,
									and admission processes to be more diverse and inclusive, and hosts social events with the department.
